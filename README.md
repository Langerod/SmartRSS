SmartRSS
========

Smart RSS is a python script for handeling RSS feeds in a 'smart' and easy way.


The goal is for the script, when used over time, to learn what items/entries in the feeds added the user finds interesting, so that it will be possible to predict if _new_ items/entries in the feeds would be considered interesting to the user.

Status:
- Uses the linux command notify-send to show messages. This will eventually be swiched with Growl, so that user interaction will be possible, and the script can be used cross platform.
- Currently focusing on YouTube feeds to easier find features from the items to use.
- No GUI added as it is not stricktly nessesary for the script to work.


I have no intentions to sell the application, so feel free to use it or develop it futher.
